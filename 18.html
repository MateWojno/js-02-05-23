   <h1> JavaScript Variables </h1>
   <p> Create a variable, assign a value to it, and display it:</p>
   <p id="demo"></p>
   <script>
    let carName = "Volvo";
    document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = carName;
    // it is a good programming practice to declare all variables at the beginning of a script

    // value = undefined, means that variable is declared without a value yet;
    // You can re-declare variable with var keyword - like var carName = "Volvo"; var carName; - then it won't 
    // lost it's  value, but you can't do that with let or const keyword!!!
   </script>
